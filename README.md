# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository 📚

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains Java files from labs and assignments completed as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms unit.

## Overview 🪟

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Java implementations for various data structures and algorithms. Each folder represents a specific topic or concept covered throughout your unit on data structures and algorithms.

### Labs 🧪🔬

The `labs` directory contains Java files from the lab sessions conducted during the unit. These files typically demonstrate the implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting algorithms, and more.

### Assignments 📑

The `assignments` directory contains Java files submitted as assignments during the unit. These files often include more advanced implementations, complex algorithms, and problem-solving exercises related to data structures and algorithms.

## Usage 

Feel free to explore the files in this repository to review concepts covered in your unit, reference implementations for your own projects, or practice coding exercises. You can clone the repository locally to your machine and import the Java files into your preferred Java IDE for further exploration and experimentation.

## Academic Unit 🏫👩‍🏫👨‍🏫

This repository serves as an academic resource for your unit on data structures and algorithms. It represents your efforts in understanding and implementing fundamental concepts in computer science, preparing you for more advanced topics and real-world applications.

## Credits 🎞️
