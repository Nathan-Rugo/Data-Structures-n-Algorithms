# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository 📚

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains Java files from labs and CAT II completed as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms unit.

## Overview 🪟

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Java implementations for various data structures and algorithms. Each folder represents a specific topic or concept covered throughout my unit on data structures and algorithms.

### Labs 🧪🔬

The `labs` directory contains Java files and word files saved as markdown files which are from the lab sessions conducted during the unit. These files typically demonstrate the implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting algorithms, and more.

### CAT II 📑

The `CAT II` directory contains Java files and markdown files which are CAT II questions given and to be submitted.

## Usage 

Feel free to explore the files in this repository. 
- **`Please read all README files in the all the subfolder. They explain details about the code or problem the code files try to solve`**

## Academic Unit 🏫👩‍🏫👨‍🏫

This repository serves as an academic resource for my unit on data structures and algorithms. It represents my efforts in understanding and implementing fundamental concepts in computer science, preparing you for more advanced topics and real-world applications.

## Credits 🎞️

This repository is maintained by Nathan Githinji [166386] as part of my academic journey in learning data structures and algorithms. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are always welcome!
