## Lab Task Guideline for Stack Operations 🧪

### Instructions:

1. **Create `StackTest1.java` Test Class** 🧪
    - Implement a `main` method to test the `StackX1` class.

2. **Create `StackX1` Instance** 🔢
    - Instantiate the `StackX1` class with a stack size of 10 elements.

3. **Push 10 Items into the Stack** ➕
    - Use the `push()` method to add 10 items to the stack.

4. **Print Stack Contents** 🖨️
    - Implement a method to print the contents of the stack.

5. **Print Top of the Stack** 🚀
    - Use appropriate method to print the top element of the stack.

6. **Push Another Element** 🔄
    - Attempt to push another element; ensure no overflow error occurs.

7. **Test for Overflow Error Handling** ⚠️
    - Modify the `push()` method to prevent overflow errors when adding more elements.

8. **Pop 5 Elements from the Stack** ❌
    - Use the `pop()` method to remove 5 elements from the stack.

9. **Print Updated Stack Contents** 📄
    - Display the current contents of the stack after popping elements.

10. **Print Top of the Stack Again** 🖨️
    - Ensure the correct top element is printed after popping.

11. **Attempt to Pop 6 Elements** 🔄
    - Check for underflow error handling in the `pop()` method.

### Part 2: Palindrome Check

1. **Create/Modify `StackX2` Class** ✏️
    - Update the `StackX2` class to support palindrome checking.

2. **Create `StackTest2.java` Test Class** 🧪
    - Implement a `main` method to test the palindrome functionality of `StackX2`.

3. **Test Sample Palindromes** 🔄
    - Use the modified class to test with various sample palindromes.

### Task Progression:
- Follow the sequence from setting up the test classes to implementing stack methods and testing functionalities.
- Ensure each step is completed and tested thoroughly before proceeding.

### Additional Notes:
- Document any encountered errors and their resolutions.
- Use comments to explain your code implementation where necessary.
- Test edge cases to ensure robustness of the stack operations.

By following these steps, you will effectively implement and test the functionalities of the stack classes as per the lab requirements.
