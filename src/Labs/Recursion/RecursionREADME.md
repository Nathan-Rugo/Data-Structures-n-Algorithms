## Labs
The `labs` section contains lab questions relating to the concept of recursion. The `Problems and Solutions` section explains the problem and which file has the solution to that problem.
# Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1 - Countdown
**Description:** Write a Java program based on recursion that will count down numbers from number `n` (input by a user) to 0 while printing the numbers out.

**Solution File:** [Countdown](Labs/Countdown.java)

### Problem 2 â€“ NumberPrinter
**Description:** Write a Java program that uses recursion to print numbers within a certain range (start to end). The user should input the values for start and end.

**Solution File:** [NumberPrinter](Labs/NumberPrinter.java)

### Problem 3 - SumCalculator
**Description:** Write a program in Java to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using recursion.

**Solution File:** [SumCalculator](Labs/SumCalculator.java)

### Problem 4 - ArrayPrinter 
**Description:** Write a complete program in Java to print array elements using recursion.

**Solution File:** [ArrayPrinter](Labs/ArrayPrinter.java)

### Problem 5 - GCDCalculator
**Description:** Write a program in Java to find the GCD of two numbers using recursion.

**Solution File:** [GCDCalculator](Labs/GCDCalculator.java)


## cw
The `cw` section contains practical implementation of pseudocode gone through in class specifically **implementation of finding the answer power of an integer** both iteratively and recursively.
