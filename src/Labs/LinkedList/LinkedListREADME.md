## Lab Task Guideline for LinkedList Operations 📝

### Instructions:

1. **Create `LinkedListTest1.java` Test Class** 🧪
    - Implement a `main` method to test the `LinkedList` class.

2. **Add 5 Items to LinkedList** 📝
    - Use the `add()` method to insert 5 items (text or numbers).
    - Check for errors and explain any encountered.

3. **Add a Head Node** 🚀
    - Utilize the `addToHead()` method to add a head node.

4. **Add Five More Nodes** ➕
    - Extend the linked list using the `add()` method for five additional nodes.

5. **Print Linked List Contents** 🖨️
    - Implement the `traverse` method to display the linked list contents.

6. **Modify `add()` Method** ✏️
    - Update the `addSpecific()` method to support adding both head and other nodes seamlessly.

7. **Delete First and Second Item** ❌
    - Implement deletion of the first and second items in the linked list.

8. **Add Item to Index 5** 📊
    - Insert an item at index 5 of the linked list.

9. **Print Updated Contents** 📄
    - Display the updated contents of the linked list.

10. **Correct Delete Method** 🛠️
    - Fix the `delete` method to accurately remove specified nodes.

11. **Correct Get Method** 🔄
    - Adjust the `get` method to retrieve the correct node.

### Task Progression:
- Follow the sequence from setting up the test class to implementing and refining the LinkedList methods.
- Ensure each step is completed and tested thoroughly before moving to the next.

### Additional Notes:
- Document any errors encountered and their resolutions.
- Use comments to explain your code implementation where necessary.
- Test edge cases to ensure robustness of the LinkedList operations.

By following these steps, you will effectively implement and test the functionalities of the LinkedList class as per the lab requirements.
